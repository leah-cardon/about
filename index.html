            Hi, I'm Leah. I am a fullstack/front-end web developer with experience in ES6+ JavaScript, React, Node, CSS3+, HTML5+, and many other web development tools. I completed Hack Reactor's Advanced Software Engineering Immersive in January 2021.
            <br>
            <br>
            I came to engineering by way of sales at innovative, high-growth tech startups (fintech and ML/AI). I became really interested in what the engineering team was working on (as I had always enjoyed designing/building things and solving logical puzzles), found a mentor on the team, and built a Python project in my off hours. That experience helped me realize I had an aptitude for, and enjoyed, software development, and I since have dedicated myself to learning.
            <br>
            <br>
            My history in sales means I have a unique advantage when it comes to pure hustle. I understand the amount of work I put in directly correlates to my success and the success of the team, and it shows in my tenacity. I thrive in uncertainty and am really strong at researching and persevering through an engineering problem when the solution might not be obvious at first. I also am comfortable giving presentations and working with other teams or customers.
            <br>
            <br>
            That said, I am also very coachable; there is so much to learn from others and I value any piece of feedback I receive.
            <br>
            <br>
            Feel free to contact me anytime; would love to hear from you.
